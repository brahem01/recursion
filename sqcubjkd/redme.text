in this function we get the square and the cube for in number and reverse him 
if the reverses are prime number we count 1
the first numbe is 89:
=> the square of 89 is :7921 and the reverse is 1279 (prime number)
=> the cube of 89 is : 704969 and the reverse is 969407 (prime number)
so if we pass 1 as a parameter the output is 89
